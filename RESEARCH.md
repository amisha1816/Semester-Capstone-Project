In the video, Clear Code creates a ```GameState class``` within ```main.py``` for the different screens. We would have three (maybe 4) screens for our game: main page, inventory, farmer's market and log in screen (❓).  

The ```GameState class``` pulls code from the while loop below for each of it's different methods:

*We should move everything inside the loop except I think the clock which is ok to stay*

To make the method an object we just need to add the line ```game_state = GameState()``` somewhere within these lines of code:

Also, we need to add game_state.main_game() to our original while loop so we can change the screens.

*this is how the tutorial did it, we're going to have to adjust it with our ```farmet's market button```

 - explains basics of how to code an inventory class
    - for the parameters we need to pass "name" and "pos" 
        - 'name' is for the name of item we accessing while "pos" is where we want to place the item 
    - in __init__ function we should load in the images of all items we could possibely have in our class and get its rect
         - self.image=pg.image.load(name)
